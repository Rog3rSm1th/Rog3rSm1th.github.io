      <description>The Okamoto-Uchiyama cryptosystem is a semantically secure, asymmetric encryption algorithm. It was first introduced in 1998 by Tatsuaki Okamoto and Shigenori Uchiyama. The method is additive-homomorphic, which means that the plaintexts are added by multiplying two ciphertexts. It is therefore not necessary to decrypt the ciphertexts in order to be able to operate on the plaintexts.
 While searching for implementations of this algorithm on github, I realized that there were only two rough implementations.</description>
