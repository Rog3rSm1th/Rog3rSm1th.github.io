      <description>Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge that occurs every December, where participants attempt to solve a set of daily puzzles that range in difficulty from easy to hard. I decided to challenge myself by attempting to solve each day&amp;rsquo;s puzzle from the 2015 edition using a different programming language.
 ðŸ¤” Why ? The goal of this project was to broaden my horizons and explore the various programming paradigms that exist, ranging from functional programming to imperative programming, and from object-oriented programming to declarative programming.</description>
